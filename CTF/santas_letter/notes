There is everything: loader, libc, makefile and source code: wow!
There is also an ascii art of santa: very funny!

PIE, with debug symbols
Makefile seems to be a normal Makefile, I also checked the exe with file command and seems that really has been compiled with that makefile

The exe first of all reads the ascii art and print i on screen maybe that could be used for the flag
Thre is a name string and then you cna create wishes, probably they will be allocated inside heap

There are WISHES and LETTERS
Maybe they have different sizes: wishes maybe fastbins and letters bigger bins?

there is also an alarm so we will need to patch the binary

STRUCT CHILD:
name: string
wishes: array of strings, max 16 wishes
wish_sizes: array of sizes, still max 16, coherent
letter: string
letter_size: unsigned long

from this struct we can see that all strings have linked a length of the string except the name string!

I have run libc_analyer and indeed confirmed that the libc provided has no tcache inside, it contains system and the /bin/sh string as always tho 

there is tho a compiler directive that is called NAME_SIZE so maybe that will be used for the NAME string

MENU:
"1) Add wish"
"2) Remove wish"
"3) Change wish"
"4) Wishes list"
"5) Prepare letter"
"6) Write letter"
"7) Trash letter"
"8) Leave"


CHILD IN HEAP:
name -> fastbin
