 - Mock League of Legends store (main Vayne here)
 - By examining closely the source code we can see that both `Product` and `State` have the method `toDict`
 - we upload a State but instead it will be the serialization of a product
 - it will print it us back but instead it will be a product with our file read, obtaining the flag
