No source code this time..
Hint says flag is inside env variable so I think its better if we look forward ways to get RCE and print the varibale
or pieces of code that will print variables directly or indirectly..

PHP backend

download replay lets me download the serialized version of the game object
My gues is that the initgameboard is initialized with the seed rand

we can also load a replay to review a game
It will iterate through the actions array
I bet this input file will do the unserialization not checking input before

I need to try to understand what those variables in the right part of the screen are

I bet the color mode is just a color mode

I bet the javascript is doing the moves.. I need to check how it reads the file and perfoms the moves

If you click next more than the times needed its a little bit broken but maybe thats not the problem..

the file is take by the endpoint /viewer.php in post

the moves are not computed client side but they are computed server side..
the js queries the back end for every move at the end point replay.php giving different parameters
action: next | prev | getGameBoard

it might be a weak equality vulnerability...
maybe in the actions on the board or in the actions in replay.php..


Theres also another variable called ranking.. my guess is that it is inside the same object Game... cause the file from it comes is Game.php..

I could try to upload a game file but with also the ranking setted

I have 2 options or I try to embedd ranking inside the game object...
or I try to upload a ranking object
