# 1024
 - 1024 game clone
 - the button to change color can actually be used to get the source code by modifying the query parameter but in this writeup it hasn't been realized
 - we can upload a replay. Instead of uploading a replay we will upload a Game object with the ranking object set
 - the ranking will put our command in the path file
 - we can read the file just by querying it obtaining the flag
