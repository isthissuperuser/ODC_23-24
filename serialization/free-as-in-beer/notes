PHP server

If we go to the source page we can see the source code of the home page

The homepage cycls through the todos and prints them

then theres a form that points to the same pae and adds a todo in the cookies

todos cookie is divided in 2 parts: first 32 chars are the digest, second ones are the serialized data

it computes the hash of only the first 32 chars

if source is set in the parameters than the source code is displayed

theres no javascript

I could try to set a cookie with some php content and hope that when printed the code will get executed	

We have created a script that creates the same object the sourcepage uses to print files but we have se tthe source property of it to the file containing the flag

we then serialized the object and got the digest of the serialization. We set the cookie as the concat of digest and serial object url encoded and got te flag

It exploits the fact that it is printing a fail of unsanitized input
