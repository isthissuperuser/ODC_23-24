there are admin users and non admin users
non admin users can only see enabled challenges
when I am registering a user first it is created and then it is put not admin via the fix_user function
the users are created admin by default

in download_user.php theres a weird line "file 'user.bak'"

upload_user lets us set the session of a user of our choice
we can try faking being admin and reading the challenges


I can execute a challenge and basically this means doing exec($setup_cmd)
