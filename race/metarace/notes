there are admin users and non admin users
non admin users can only see enabled challenges
when I am registering a user first it is created and then it is put not admin via the fix_user function
the users are created admin by default

in download_user.php theres a weird line "file 'user.bak'"

upload_user lets us set the session of a user of our choice
we can try faking being admin and reading the challenges


I can execute a challenge and basically this means doing exec($setup_cmd)

I need a way to run challenges..

uploading a user with a modified isAdmin value doesnt work cause challenges are downloaded at login time...
I have to register and then try immediately to login in that way I will have the challenges good
and then try to print..

if I put a long name query will take longer. There is no limit on name size i think

ok apparently admin users don't have any challenge activated.. mmh, cause there is no enabled challenge. But this is weird cause admins should see all the challenges..
I have to study more the code
